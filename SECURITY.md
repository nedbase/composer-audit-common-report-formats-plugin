# Security Policy

Nedbase takes security very serious. Nonetheless, security issues may arise.
This document provides detailed information on how security issues may be
reported and how they will be dealt with.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

**Please do not create a GitHub Issue to report a vulnerability!**

Please report any security vulnerabilities privately to security@nedbase.nl.
We have a [security.txt](https://www.nedbase.nl/.well-known/security.txt) in
place with additional information, such as our public PGP key.

## How Vulnerability Reports are handled

When we receive a vulnerability report, a member of our Security Team works
privately with the reporter to resolve the issue. When the issue is resolved,
a new release will be made including the fix for the issue. The vulnerability
will be publicly announced.
